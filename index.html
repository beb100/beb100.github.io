    <h1>Pennsylvania State Police</h1>

    <p>
        The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) is one of the earliest statewide law enforcement 
        agencies in the United States. PSP is responsible for highway patrol, criminal 
        investigations, and public safety services across the Commonwealth.  
        This website provides a simple overview of the PA State Police, including trooper 
        salary and benefits, and a closer look at daily life at the PSP Academy.

    <h2>About the PA State Police</h2>
    <p>
        PSP was established in 1905 and has grown into a modern law enforcement agency 
        with specialized units, advanced technology, and a strong commitment to serving 
        local communities. Troopers are trained to handle everything from traffic enforcement 
        and crash investigations to emergency response and major criminal cases.

    <h2>Pennsylvania State Police Historical Facts and Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        Pennsylvania’s coal fields, iron mills, and timber forests played a vital role in the Industrial Revolution. Pennsylvania changed in the late 1800s from a largely agricultural State into a complex industrial center.
    </p>
    <p>
        By 1900, it found itself torn by bitter disputes between managers and the laborers they employed. Violence became common in the new communities that sprang up around the coal fields, iron mills, textile factories, and railroad yards.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the turn of the century, it was evident that the town constables, sheriffs, and similar local officials, who had been adequate to keep the peace in more stable times, were unable to cope with the new populations and the violent labor troubles of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
        To provide themselves protection that the Commonwealth did not provide, the coal and steel operators persuaded the State Legislature to authorize the creation of what became the infamous Coal and Iron Police. For one dollar each, the State sold to the mine and steel mill owners, commissions conferring police power upon whomever the owners selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through these commissions, armies of guards were raised, ostensibly to protect private property, but actually used to enforce the wills of the owners. Often common gunmen, hoodlums, and adventurers were hired to fill these commissions and they served their own interests by causing the violence and terror that gave them office.
    </p>
    <p>
        The turning point came in 1902 with what became known as The Great Anthracite Strike. It began May 15 and lasted until October 23. The violence disrupted the peace of seven counties and caused a nationwide coal shortage, driving up the price of anthracite coal.
